Go to the Data tab → Click Sort

Sort by Priority Rank (smallest to largest)

Explanation of the Formula
- SEARCH("@bac.com", C2) checks if the email contains that domain.

- ISNUMBER(...) ensures the domain was actually found.

- IF(..., rank, next condition) chains through your priority list.

- If no match is found, it defaults to 99.
