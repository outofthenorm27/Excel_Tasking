Step 1: Create a New Column
In Column D, title the header: Priority Rank

Step 2: Enter the Formula in Cell D2

=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("@bac.com", C2)), 1,
 IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("@baml.com", C2)), 2,
 IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("@bofa.com", C2)), 3,
 IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("@bankofamerica.com", C2)), 4,
 IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("@ml.com", C2)), 5, 99)))))

Step 3: Drag the Formula Down
Select cell D2

Hover over the bottom-right corner of the cell (you’ll see a small square “handle”)

Click and drag down to fill the formula for all rows

Step 4: Sort by Priority (Optional)
Select the full table (including headers)

Go to the Data tab → Click Sort

Sort by Priority Rank (smallest to largest)

Explanation of the Formula
- SEARCH("@bac.com", C2) checks if the email contains that domain.

- ISNUMBER(...) ensures the domain was actually found.

- IF(..., rank, next condition) chains through your priority list.

- If no match is found, it defaults to 99.





To add an indicator in Column C when the SMTP address (Column B) does not contain any name components from the NAME column (Column A), you can use the following formula in cell C2 and copy it down:

=IF(AND(ISERROR(SEARCH(LEFT(A2,FIND(",",A2)-1),B2)), ISERROR(SEARCH(TRIM(RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(",",A2))),B2))), "Name Mismatch", "")


Explanation:

  LEFT(A2,FIND(",",A2)-1) extracts the last name.
  
  TRIM(RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(",",A2))) extracts the first name.
  
  SEARCH(...,B2) checks if each name component is found in the SMTP address.
  
  If neither name is found (AND(ISERROR(...))), it marks as "Name Mismatch".





To apply the updated logic (only accept emails in the formats first.last or firstInitial+last), and exclude partial matches like "cn=rnorman" or "x400, norman", here's the improved Excel formula you can use in Column C, starting from C2:


=LET(
    fullName, A2,
    first, LOWER(TRIM(RIGHT(fullName,LEN(fullName)-FIND(",",fullName)))),
    last, LOWER(LEFT(fullName,FIND(",",fullName)-1)),
    email, LOWER(B2),
    dotFormat, first & "." & last,
    shortFormat, LEFT(first,1) & last,
    validEmail, OR(ISNUMBER(SEARCH(dotFormat,email)), ISNUMBER(SEARCH(shortFormat,email))),
    IF(validEmail, "", "Name Mismatch")
)






To include more name format variations in your validation logic — now allowing:

 first.last
 
 first_last
 
 last.first
 
 last_first
 
 firstInitial + last



=IF(OR(
  ISNUMBER(SEARCH(LOWER(TRIM(RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(",",A2)))) & "." & LOWER(LEFT(A2,FIND(",",A2)-1)), LOWER(B2))),
  ISNUMBER(SEARCH(LOWER(TRIM(RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(",",A2)))) & "_" & LOWER(LEFT(A2,FIND(",",A2)-1)), LOWER(B2))),
  ISNUMBER(SEARCH(LOWER(LEFT(A2,FIND(",",A2)-1)) & "." & LOWER(TRIM(RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(",",A2)))), LOWER(B2))),
  ISNUMBER(SEARCH(LOWER(LEFT(A2,FIND(",",A2)-1)) & "_" & LOWER(TRIM(RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(",",A2)))), LOWER(B2))),
  ISNUMBER(SEARCH(LOWER(LEFT(SUBSTITUTE(TRIM(RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(",",A2)))," ",""),1) & LOWER(LEFT(A2,FIND(",",A2)-1))), LOWER(B2)))
), "", "Name Mismatch")




To detect mismatches where the email in Column C is either not in standard email format or does not match the name in Column B, you can use a formula like this in cell D2 and drag it down:

=IF(OR(
     ISERROR(SEARCH("@", C2)), 
     NOT(ISNUMBER(FIND(".", C2))), 
     NOT(AND(
         ISNUMBER(SEARCH(LOWER(LEFT(B2, FIND(" ", B2 & " ") - 1)), LOWER(C2))),
         ISNUMBER(SEARCH(LOWER(TRIM(RIGHT(B2, LEN(B2) - FIND(" ", B2 & " ")))), LOWER(C2)))
     ))
), "Mismatch", "")
