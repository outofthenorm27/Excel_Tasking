Step 1: Create a New Column
In Column D, title the header: Priority Rank

Step 2: Enter the Formula in Cell D2

=IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("@bac.com", C2)), 1,
 IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("@baml.com", C2)), 2,
 IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("@bofa.com", C2)), 3,
 IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("@bankofamerica.com", C2)), 4,
 IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("@ml.com", C2)), 5, 99)))))

Step 3: Drag the Formula Down
Select cell D2

Hover over the bottom-right corner of the cell (you’ll see a small square “handle”)

Click and drag down to fill the formula for all rows

Step 4: Sort by Priority (Optional)
Select the full table (including headers)

Go to the Data tab → Click Sort

Sort by Priority Rank (smallest to largest)

Explanation of the Formula
- SEARCH("@bac.com", C2) checks if the email contains that domain.

- ISNUMBER(...) ensures the domain was actually found.

- IF(..., rank, next condition) chains through your priority list.

- If no match is found, it defaults to 99.





To add an indicator in Column C when the SMTP address (Column B) does not contain any name components from the NAME column (Column A), you can use the following formula in cell C2 and copy it down:

=IF(AND(ISERROR(SEARCH(LEFT(A2,FIND(",",A2)-1),B2)), ISERROR(SEARCH(TRIM(RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(",",A2))),B2))), "Name Mismatch", "")


Explanation:

  LEFT(A2,FIND(",",A2)-1) extracts the last name.
  
  TRIM(RIGHT(A2,LEN(A2)-FIND(",",A2))) extracts the first name.
  
  SEARCH(...,B2) checks if each name component is found in the SMTP address.
  
  If neither name is found (AND(ISERROR(...))), it marks as "Name Mismatch".





To apply the updated logic (only accept emails in the formats first.last or firstInitial+last), and exclude partial matches like "cn=rnorman" or "x400, norman", here's the improved Excel formula you can use in Column C, starting from C2:


=LET(
    fullName, A2,
    first, LOWER(TRIM(RIGHT(fullName,LEN(fullName)-FIND(",",fullName)))),
    last, LOWER(LEFT(fullName,FIND(",",fullName)-1)),
    email, LOWER(B2),
    dotFormat, first & "." & last,
    shortFormat, LEFT(first,1) & last,
    validEmail, OR(ISNUMBER(SEARCH(dotFormat,email)), ISNUMBER(SEARCH(shortFormat,email))),
    IF(validEmail, "", "Name Mismatch")
)





=LET(
  fullName, B2,
  email, LOWER(C2),
  nameParts, TEXTSPLIT(LOWER(fullName), " "),
  first, INDEX(nameParts, 1),
  last, IF(COUNTA(nameParts) > 1, INDEX(nameParts, COUNTA(nameParts)), ""),
  firstInit, LEFT(first,1),
  fmt1, first & "." & last,
  fmt2, first & "_" & last,
  fmt3, first & "." & firstInit & "." & last,
  fmt4, firstInit & "." & last,
  fmt5, last & "." & first,
  fmt6, first & "." & last,
  basicValid, AND(ISNUMBER(SEARCH("@", email)), ISNUMBER(SEARCH(".", email))),
  nameMatch, OR(
    ISNUMBER(SEARCH(fmt1, email)),
    ISNUMBER(SEARCH(fmt2, email)),
    ISNUMBER(SEARCH(fmt3, email)),
    ISNUMBER(SEARCH(fmt4, email)),
    ISNUMBER(SEARCH(fmt5, email)),
    ISNUMBER(SEARCH(fmt6, email)),
    AND(ISNUMBER(SEARCH(first, email)), ISNUMBER(SEARCH(last, email)))
  ),
  IF(AND(basicValid, nameMatch), "", "Mismatch")
)
